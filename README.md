## üìù Description (Why I'm Building This)

I'm building this project to practice real-time data communication using WebSocket (Socket.IO) in a practical way. By fetching live cryptocurrency prices from the Binance API and broadcasting them to the frontend, I aim to understand how to build fast and efficient data pipelines between a Node.js server and a client app.

This helps me improve skills in:
- API integration
- WebSocket performance
- Real-time UI updates
- Handling async/parallel data fetching

It‚Äôs also a small step toward building real-world financial or trading dashboards.
